5,Artist Biography,"<P>""Paris was where the 20th century was."" Should the remark so often quoted and attributed to Gertrude Stein prove apocryphal, it would make no difference. At the turn of the century and again after World War I, it seemed that most of the artistic and literary ferment of the modern world was focused in that city. To Paris in the 1920s came Berenice Abbott, a young woman fresh from Ohio State University's School of Journalism and from New York's Greenwich Village. Yet, despite this experience, she was still looking for her career, for her real profession and life's work. Born in Ohio in 1898, she had spent unhappy early years as the child of divorced parents and, after attending Ohio State University, had left the Midwest (for good) in 1918 for New York city and the Village. Ostensibly she was seeking a career in journalism and had moved to New York intending to pursue that subject at Columbia University. In fact the move to New York only presaged another in 1921, this time to Paris to study sculpture. ""You're finding yourself as you go along when you're young,""she has remarked. ""Youth often enters a field that isn't always the right choice."" (1)</P>  <P>Her discovery of the right field came in 1923 and seems to have been entirely serendipitous. The famous photographer Man Ray needed an assistant, but insisted on one without previous knowledge of the craft. Young expatriates must eat, and Abbott applied. Her lack of knowledge qualified her for the job. Soon she was printing for Man Ray and discovering that she immensely enjoyed doing darkroom work. Later, at his suggestion, Abbott began to take her own first photographs. Both were surprised to discover how good she was. By 1925, with the aid of loans from Peggy Guggenheim and from Robert McAlmon (one of the ""charmed circle"" surrounding Gertrude Stein), she had set up her own studio on the Left Bank. There she pursued portrait photography which absorbed her at that time.</P>  <P>A selection of images of the stream of notables who found their way to Berenice Abbott's studio are presented in this exhibition. Figures from the world of fashion and the haut monde of Parisian society mix freely with some of the era's legendary literary figures and artists, including the dadaists and surrealists out <I>pour ¨¦pater le bourgeois.</I> Abbott presents them all with what one can only term an imaginative realism.</P>  <P>Each subject was extremely important to her. ""I wasn't trying to make a still life of them,"" she has said, ""but a person. Its a kind of exchange between people¡ªit has to be¡ªand I enjoyed it."" (2) Formal posing was totally foreign to her approach. Her subjects tend to move casually; frequently they slouch. Occasionally perhaps captured in conversation or interaction with her, they strike self-assertive or deliberately playful stances. Always she is a master at catching the telling gesture (the languid, listless hand of James Joyce) or the detail of dress or accessory (the elegant pince-nez of Mrs. Theodore van Rysselberghe and the large ring on her forefinger) that reveals character as strongly as face or eyes. Less frequently Abbott experimented with arbitrary cropping to create a mood, one to us redolent of the art deco aesthetic first formally presented to Paris and the world in 1925 at L'Exposition internationale des arts d¨¦coratifs et industriels modernes. How could she not be aware of and sensitive to the international movements in art that crowded the Paris horizon? Yet, through it all, we sense a serious intelligence and a sturdy individuality developing and gathering force.</P>  <P>The years in Paris also brought an obsession into Abbott's life¡ªthe work of the French photographer Eugene Atget (1857¨C1927). Now some fifty years after his death honored by exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, he was largely unknown or rejected in Paris during the 1920s. (Even as late as 1967 or 1968, Abbott says, the French authorities rejected the Atget collection when she offered it to them through the French Minister of Culture, Andr¨¦ Malraux.) Abbott had first become aware of the work of this unrecognized master of photography through Man Ray. The impact of Atget's work on her was immediate and she periodically bought his photographs, as many as she could afford, for a few francs each. After Atget's death she purchased his collection of some 10,000 images¡ªboth prints and negatives¡ªfrom his closest friend, Andr¨¦ Calmette. A labor of love followed as Abbott saw that each glass plate negative was cleaned and stored in a numbered glassine envelope. Then she began her long and until recently quite fruitless campaign to have Atget's work recognized. The resistance she met reveals the attitudes of the art world of the day: a preoccupation with abstraction, an abhorrence and denigration of realism as trivial and trite, and grave doubts as to the legitimacy of photography as an art. (The September 1951 issue of <I>Art News,</I> for example introduced an article by Berenice Abbott with the rhetorical questions, ""Does photography belong in museums? In fact, is it an art at all?"") (3) Abbott's fight for Atget's recognition demanded her time, attention, persistence, and self-sacrifice, often at the expense of her own career.</P>  <P>Despite her success in Paris, by 1929 Abbott was ready to return home. On a visit to America she became excited by New York city. She has said that she became interested in the States from a distance, that some persons abroad become fascinated with their own country. She had left her homeland out of frustration with a country that offered very little encouragement for the arts. Abbott feels that her relocation to Europe was an act of justified rebellion. Yet, she has said that ""after years in Paris I found myself drawn by a certain nostalgia and an objective interest [in the United States] that crept up over the years."" (4)</P>  <P>Fascinated by New York City and the changes that had occurred in it during her absence, she began the monumental work of documenting its visual presence¡ªits sweeping technological innovations, its bridges, its canyonlike streets overtowered by skyscrapers (many of the most famous under construction at that time), its nineteenth-century brownstones and even earlier vestiges of colonial architecture, its littered streets, its hum and vitality, its sparkling transformation at night into a fairyland of light and glitter. The rest is history. The right artist and the right project¡ªone demanding perseverance, vitality, and great individuality of imagination¡ªhad met. Her efforts were finally rewarded in 1935 when the New Deal's Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration agreed to sponsor her documentation of New York under the project title ""Changing New York."" The book of the same title, published in 1939, was a milestone in the history of photography.</P>  <P>Since 1939 Abbott has engaged in many projects, turning her attention to the photography of scientific phenomena and working for the Physical Science Study Committee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She now lives in rural Maine, where she moved in 1962. She continues to be outspoken in her comments concerning photography which she believes is the most important art form of our time. ""It took the modern period to develop an art based on scientific sources, on chemistry and optics. The vision of the twentieth century has been created by photography."" (5)</P>  <P>As for realism and the mechanistic aspect of photography, her own summing up of her experience with a camera presents a powerful, lucid argument for the creativity of the photographer and also provides insights into our responses to her photographs:</P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>""By the choice of subject and the special treatment given a subject, [the photograph] is as personal as writing or music; while by the fact that it works with an instrument to record a segment of reality given and already made ¡­ it is impersonal, to the highest degree."" (6) </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P>Abbott also believes that ""while significant reality is the subject matter of the photographer, it follows that ¡­ the choice of subject is inescapably a subjective one. One cannot help equating the objective world with oneself."" (7)</P>  <P>We, too, read ourselves into her photographs, experiencing the New York of the 1980s more fully and acutely by savoring her images of the 1930s. Her photographs of both the twenties and the thirties provide us with more than a souvenir, more than a record or document. By an act of creative imagination Berenice Abbott has revealed to us something of the indestructible essence of a place or a time that resists oblivion and change. For many of us, this creative act seems both life-enhancing and revitalizing.</P><BR><BR>  <P>1. Conversation with Berenice Abbott, February 25, 1982.

23,Luce Artist Biography,"<p>Despite his working-class background, Herbert Adams insisted on becoming an artist. His father discouraged him on practical grounds and was successful in getting Adams to attend technical school, at least temporarily. At eighteen, the artist worked as a taxidermist, which only increased his desire to study art---especially sculpture. After two years of hard work his patience paid off. He was allowed to enroll at the Massachusetts Normal Art School in Boston. Adams excelled in sculpture and continued his studies, first at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then in Italy, where he was particularly influenced by the work of the Renaissance period. This influence is visible in many of his portrait busts, which are colored in warm tones instead of being rendered in solid white marble. Adams combined different types of marble with wood and gold to color his marble busts, and applied stains or paints to tint the surface of his plaster works.</p>",NULL

He attended summer classes in Woodstock, New York, taught by Andrew Dasburg, who encouraged him to move to New Mexico in 1924, where Adams lived until his death. His compassionate regard for Hispanics and a renewed interest in landscape largely determined the subjects of his paintings. Adams was the last artist to join the Taos Society of Artists before it disbanded in 1927.

26,Artist Biography,"<P>The works of basket maker Mary Adams represent the ingenious marriage of traditional Mohawk crafts with contemporary popular forms.

26,Artist Biography,"<P>Mary Adams's life¡ªher dual Mohawk and Catholic heritage¡ªis interwoven with her splint ash and sweet grass baskets. During a childhood of poverty in the late 1920s along the banks of the St. Lawrence Riber on the Mohawk Akwesasne Reserve, which straddles the New York/Canadian border, she made baskets to provide for herself and her brother. Later, freed from the economic necessity of having to produce them for a living, she devoted her time to creating innovative, ornate baskets and grew into an artist of international stature. Highly sculpted basketry art forms such as the Wedding Cake Basket, which she made in 1986 for the twenty fifth wedding anniversary of one of her children, and the Pope Basket represent the ulmination of her life's work. (1)<P>I was honored to interview Adams a few months before her death on May 23, 1999, at age eighty two, at her daughter Trudy Lauzon's home in Fort Covington, New York, near the reserve. We talked about her work, especially the creation and presentation of a basket to John Paul II in 1980 to commemorate the beatification of Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American to be declared ""blessed"" by the Roman Catholic Church.</P>  <P>Mary Kawennatakie Adams, whose traditional name means a ""voice coming toward us,"" was born January 24, 1917, at Kawehnoke, or Cornwall Island, Ontario. She was a member of the Wolf Clan of the Kahnawake Mohawk Nation (""People of Flint"") of the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee). She had no formal education after age sixteen and did not learn English until well into adulthood.<P>From her mother, Adams learned to make traditional Mohawk splint ash and sweet grass baskets when she was six years old. When she was ten, her mother died, and her father left the reserve to seek employment as an ironworker, a common practice among the Mohawk, who were legendary in producing generations of skillful high steel workers for tall buildings and bridges. Left behind on the reserve to support herself and her older brother, Adams began making baskets.</P>  <P>To begin the process, she followed her mother's example, and instructed her brother to fell the ash trees so that she could prepare the wood splints. Within a few days, Adams had made about a dozen baskets and sent her brother to the local non Native American merchant, Mr. MacKinnon, who traded them for cigarettes. When her brother asked her what she would do with cigarettes, she told him that they would take them to Cornwall, acrosss the north channel of the St. Lawrence, to another merchant to trade them for cash. She and her mother had often visited him, before the family moved south to the Quebec part of the St. Regis community on the Akwesasne Reserve.</P><P>Adams told me of her relief when, after presenting the cigarettes to him, he automatically gave her the money, without asking her anything. She did not know English and would have been unable to understand him. She used the cash for food and other necessities. She explained further, ""Sometimes, we would [be] sitting all night working on the baskets to get done, so we would get the money to buy our groceries. That is the way we were, I don't kow how many years.""</P>  <P>Adams married at age seventeen and continued to sell her baskets to Mr. MacKinnon, for cash now instead of cigarettes. Adams recounted that he ""ripped her off"" for the little three&nbsp; or four inch sweet grass and splint ash baskets: ""That son of a gun, he pays [for the] basket twenty five cents a dozen. The whole reservation, we used to make baskets. Son of a gun, he never pay any more than that, twenty five cents, that kind of basket."" With a strong Mohawk accent, Adams continued, ""When my mother used to make baskets, she sits on the rocking chair and you all sit around her and she teaches us how to make baskets. Then after she is gone, then I keep on. I never quit, not even a day. Every day I am doing them, and I have got a big family. I raised my family with my bakets. I have got twelve kids.""</P>  <P>Adams's tenacity in making baskets full time produced an income that provided stability for her large family in the St. Regis community. (2) She ws also active in her church, the St. Regis Roman Catholic Church, which was founded as a Jesuit Mission in 1752. Continuing the community centered tradition of the Mohawk, Adams shared the original patterns and surface designs in her basketry with her family and the women at Akwesasne, and also traveled widely to give demonstrations of Mohawk basket making.</P>  <P>By the time she reached her early fifties, Adams was finally financially independent. No longer burdened with meeting the demands of wholesale basket merchants, Adams had time to execute baskets that were imaginative and distinctive. Later, she began making the ornate baskets for which she received international acclaim. Her baskets are found in institutions throughout North America, including the Iroquois Indian Museum, New York; the Thunder Bay Art Gallery, Ontario; the New York State Governor's Collection of Art, Albany; and the Smithsonian, Washington, D.C. In 1997 the Iroquoiss Indian Museum presented her with its ""Excellence in Iroquois Arts Award"" for the category ""The Best of the Best."" (3)</P>  <P>Like other parishioners at St. Regis Catholic Church, Adams ws a devotee of Kateri Takawitha, a seventeenth century Kahnawake Mohawk woman, known as ""The Lily of the Mohawks."" Takakwitha was the daughter of a Christian Algonquin mother and a non Christian Mohawk chief. Her parents and brother died in a smallpox epidemc; she survived, but the disease weakened her health and severly scarred her face. She performed extraordinary penances and was devoted to helping children and the elederly. It is said that because of her great faith her pockmarks disappeared when she died at the age of twenty four. In 1943, the Roman Catholic Church delcared her ""venable."" Later, the Church declared her blssed, the second of three steps toward canonization.<P>Wishing to attend the beatification ceremony at the Vatican, Adams and her fellow parishioners raised funds to cover their expenses. Adams wanted to make a commemorative basket in Kateri's honor to present to Pope John Paul II. She saw this act of gift giving as honoring both her Christian and Mohawk roots. The gift symbolized the Christian tradition of presenting a Eucharist offering to the pope who would say mass for the occasion. It also represented the Iroquois ceremony of giving thanks to natural and supernatural beings for their generosity, a kind of gift exchange or thanksgiving. (4) ?</P<P>Significantly, Adams drew from her Mohawk heritage and the traditional cosmology of the Northeastern Native American Indian by placing clusters of tiny baskets on four equidistant walls and the lid of the [Pope B]asket. The sweet grass used in the basket's contruction is sacred to many Native Americans, and to the Mohawk people in particular. There is a saying in Akwesasne that the basket making community lives where Teionkwahontasen, or sweet grass, ""grows around us or surrounds us."" (6) Indeed, I saw sweet grass near Adams's home on a channel of the St. Lawrence.</P>  <P>Adams's lifelong ambition, like that of other Mohawk basket makers, was to continue making baskets until she died. During her life, she produced more than twenty five thousand baskets and developed traditional Mohawk basketry into a highly decorative art form. Almost up until the time of her death in 1999, and even with failing eyesight, she was still able to braid sweet grass, which she then gave to her daughter to incorporate into her baskets. Just as Adams learned the technique of making baskets form her mother, Trudy learned the craft from her. Adams's baskets are woven from her life story, reflecting her experiences as both a Catholic, intimate with liturgical symbolism, and a Kahnawake Mohawk, surrounded by sweet grass growing abundantly in the flowing river marshes of Akwesasne.</P>  <P>Notes </P>  <P>1.

46,Artist Biography,"<p>An elementary school teacher for twelve years, and an instructor at the Bauhaus from 1923  until 1933, Josef Albers was one of the most influential artist-educators to immigrate to the United States during the 1930s. Following early academic training at the Royal Art School in Berlin (1913&ndash;15), the <i>Kunstgewerbeschule</i> in Essen (part-time from 1916 to 1919), and the Art Academy in Munich (1919&ndash;20), Albers turned in 1920 to the innovative atmosphere of the Weimar Bauhaus. There he began his experimental work as an abstract artist. After three years as a student, he was hired to teach the famed Vorkurs, the introductory class that immersed students in the principles of design and the behavior of materials.</p><p>Albers was convinced that students needed to develop an understanding of ""the static and dynamic properties of materials. . . through direct experience."" His students made constructions with wire netting, matchboxes, phonograph needles, razor blades, and other unusual materials. They also visited workshops where craftsmen worked daily with the structural and behavioral characteristics of industrial and natural materials.(1)</p><p>In his own work, Albers investigated color theory and composition. He began to explore mathematical proportions as a way to achieve balance and unity in his art. Yet, Albers did not aim to be a purely analytical painter. Although he had not taken classes with either Klee or Kandinsky as a Bauhaus student, and did not profess metaphysical concerns, Albers believed that Art is spirit, and only the quality of spirit gives the arts an important place in. . . life.""(2)</p><p>Albers had come to his own brand of abstraction over the course of many years. By 1908, he had discovered Matisse and C&#233;zanne, and in Berlin he encountered work by Munch, van Gogh, the German Expressionists, Delaunay, and the Italian Futurists. Initially an expressionist, Albers began experimenting with abstract principles and unusual materials about 1923. His glass assemblages of these formative years explored the possibilities of stained, sandblasted, and constructed arrangements.

In 1933, when the Nazis forced the closing of the Berlin Bauhaus, Albers left for America where he introduced Bauhaus concepts of art and design to the newly formed experimental community of Black Mountain College in North Carolina.</p><p>After fifteen years he left Black Mountain and, in 1950, became chairman of the Department of Design at Yale. <i>On Tideland,</i> painted between 1947 and 1955, marks this transition and was painted concurrently with the earliest examples of his well-known series, <i>Homage to the Square.</i></p><p>Albers, always a careful craftsman, was concerned that future generations understand his working methods. He often documented, on the reverse of the fiberboard panels he preferred for his paintings, the pigments, brands, varnishes, and grounds he had used in making the painting. Fascinating notations document his spatial proportions and the mathematic schemes he incorporated in each work. <i>On Tideland,</i> for example, was painted according to ""Scheme M,"" in which twenty units of vertical form balance thirty units of horizontal form. Although concerned with a severely restricted format in his own work, Albers admitted other approaches: ""Any form [of art] is acceptable if it is true,"" he stated.

52,Luce Artist Biography,"<p>Ivan Albright's father was a painter, and the young artist often modeled for him, alongside his identical twin brother, Marvin. Ivan grew tired of people asking if he was going to be an artist like his father, and so decided to study architecture instead. He finally realized that painting was his ""only resource,"" however, and transferred to art school, closely followed by his brother. They built adjoining studios in Warrington, Illinois, and had a very supportive relationship, even though each twin kept the other from entering his workspace. Albright was fascinated by the aging process and created images of everyday people that highlighted every wrinkle, hair, blemish, and bulge. He worked slowly, completing one square inch every ten hours, and some canvases took more than a decade to finish. He enjoyed painting figures and still lifes, and when asked to explain why he did not create many landscapes, he said: ""I find that my thumb close up is as big as the highest mountains . . . I would in that case rather paint my thumb, because I can get around it easier and see what it is all about.""

55,Artist Biography,"<p>John White Alexander, a native of Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, worked as an illustrator in <i>Harper and Brothers</i> in his youth, just as Winslow Homer had done a decade before. In 1877, White joined the 'Duveneck boys' in Munich, where training, much influenced by Hals, Vel&#225;zquez and Courbet, was freer and looser than that of Paris or Dusseldorf. The work of the Munich artists was often richly brushed in a predominantly dark palette, and although the vogue was brief and was supplanted by the Barbizon and Paris schools, it produced a number of talented Americans, notably Frank Duveneck, William Merritt Chase, John White Alexander, and, John Twachtman.</p><p>In 1891, Alexander moved to Paris and over the next ten years gained prominence as an exponent of the current Art Noveau trend. However this was only one of several influences that converged on him and other artists during these years. In the 1890s proponents of the so-called Aesthetic Movement decried the Ruskinian conviction that art must perform a moral and didactic function and instead asserted that art was autonomous and self-referential. Free of literary, narrative conventions, artists could favor mood over story and assert the formal, evocative properties of color and line for their own sake.</p><p>This new freedom encouraged a shift in subject matter toward the representation of objects and figures that were simply beautiful in themselves. The culture of the 1890s, gritty and ugly as it appeared, produced such subject matter in abundance. The century's end had witnessed the explosive growth of commerce, industry, and urban concentration, contributing to the creation of great fortunes in few hands; it also contributed to a radical adjustment in the social roles of women of the upper and middle classes. Deprived of the centrally productive role they had previously performed in a rural society, women were now relegated to a decorative role, serving as beautiful symbols of male wealth and status. As such they were bountifully represented by artists, and their images were eagerly acquired by patrons. It is noteworthy that in the current exhibition of fifty-two paintings there are twenty-four representations of women, almost exclusively upper class, and only one male self-portrait.</p><p>Alexander's many depictions of beautiful women were also colored by his susceptibility to the prevailing Art Nouveau, an elaborately decorative style that emphasizes the use of sinuous and sensuous contours. This movement was popularized by the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, the dramatic posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the stained glass of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Alexander's work was also touched by the prevailing vogue for symbolism, the visual evocation of an idea, of an emotion through the association of analogous qualities. </p><p>Emery Battis Artist Biographies for the exhibition <i>American Impressionism: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum</i> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2000)</p>",NULL

171,Artist Biography,"<p>Ault was brought up in England and came late to an appreciation of his American origins. After training at University College School in London, the Slade School, and St. John's Wood School of Art, his painting style was described as an Anglicized version of impressionism. But when he returned to America in 1911 he began to paint New York night scenes and architectural subjects in a spare, modernist style. This caused his father, an academic painter, to stop supporting him. In the 1920s, on vacation in Provincetown, he painted the local scenery in oils and watercolors. These works were shown at a local gallery and in New York. In the early 1930s he worked on New Deal art projects, gradually severing most of his ties with the art market. He moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1937, but avoided life in the art colony there. A nearby barn, which he painted three times, was a favorite subject, symbolizing for hire a dying, agrarian way of life in the Catskills. In this sense his work echoed, from his own modernist viewpoint, the preservationist themes of many New England artists. Ault's life, plagued by illness, depression, and poverty, ended with his suicide in 1948. </p><p>William H. Truettner and Roger B.

171,Luce Artist Biography,"<p>George Ault studied art in London, then returned to America in 1911 and settled in Hillside, New Jersey, with his family. In 1922 he established a studio in New York City, painting images inspired by the rooftops and buildings he saw from his window. Ault experienced a great deal of tragedy during the early years of his career. One of his brothers committed suicide in 1915, his mother died five years later, and his father died in 1929. After the death of his father, Ault's two remaining brothers took their own lives. In the 1930s, depressed and struggling with alcoholism, Ault lost touch with many of his artist friends and gallery contacts in New York. He moved to Woodstock with his wife, Louise, and rented a small house without indoor plumbing or electricity, isolating himself from the nearby artists' colony. By the late 1940s, the couple had very little money and most of Ault's attempts to reestablish himself in the New York art scene had failed. He died in 1948 at the age of fifty-seven, in what was probably a suicide. (Lubowsky, <i>George Ault</i>, 1988)</p>",NULL

176,Artist Biography,"<P>Milton Avery lived in and around Hartford, Connecticut, until 1925, when he moved to New York City. A factory worker as a young man, one day he saw an advertisement for a class in lettering at the Connecticut League of Art Students and enrolled. He thought he might make money at this pursuit, butwhen the class was canceled¡ªjust a month after he entered¡ªhe took a life drawing class instead. (1) In 1918, while working for an insurance company at night, he studied at the School of the Art Society of Hartford. The following year, he won top honors in the portrait and life drawing classes. In 1920 Avery began spending summers in Gloucester, Massachusetts. There, in 1924, he met a young painter named Sally Michel. He followed her to New York, and in 1926 they were married. At the beginning of their marriage, Sally Avery determined to place her own artistic concerns second to those of her husband, and she worked as a freelance illustrator to free Avery from the need to support hisfamily.</P>  <P>Avery's early training had prepared him for a career as an academic painter. But he frequented the New York galleries thatexhibited modernist European art, including the Valentine Gallery, which held a retrospective of Matisse's work in 1927. By 1930, references to Matisse and Picasso can be discerned in Avery's paintings, and he began to introduce the simplified forms and flattened space that would, along with clear, unmodulated color, become the hallmarks of his later work. The 1930s were financially precarious times for the Averys. Avery exhibited his work frequently, but it didnot sell well. However, a 1935 invitation to join the prestigious Valentine Gallery, which exhibited Matisse, Picasso, Mir¨®, Derain, Braque, Kandinsky, Stuart Davis, and others, had a vitalizing effect on his painting and his outlook.</P>  <P>Although Avery never joined any of the artists' organizations that proliferated in New York during the 1930s, the couple's apartment became a meeting ground for young painters. Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman were frequent visitors, and often joined the Averys during summers spent in Gloucester or southern Vermont. Many of Avery's paintings originated during these summers away from the city. A quiet man who seldom participated in conversations about him, Avery constantly sketched¡ªlandscapes, people, interiors¡ªwhatever was at hand. Around 1938, the Averys began organizing sketch classes where they and their friends shared the costs of a model. John Opper was among those who congregated at the Averys and remembered the lively talk and stimulating company.</P>  <P>In 1943, Avery joined the New York gallery of Paul Rosenberg, an important dealer who had been forced to flee Paris when the Nazis took the city. This affiliation, coupled with a retrospective exhibition at the Phillips Memorial Gallery in 1944, brought Avery national acclaim. Yet sales remained few, and New York museums, for the most part, showed little enthusiasm for his work. Avery persisted nonetheless, refining form and clarifying color. In 1946, the family spent three months in Mexico, where not only the landscape but the peasants and city streets offered new subject matter.Three years later Avery suffered a heart attack from which he never fully recovered. Prevented by his health from workingoutdoors, Avery began making monotypes, a medium that requires rapid execution. These monotypes affected his paintingstyle, and after about 1950, Avery increasingly eliminated extraneous detail from his work and began focusing on the harmony of the overall canvas rather than the interrelation of its parts. (2) Critical acclaim for Avery's work waned for several years during the early 1950s, eclipsed, perhaps, by Abstract Expressionism. Yet, by late in the decade, his independent vision, distilled, vibrant color, and acutely refined forms had secured his recognition as one of the most subtly powerful artists in mid-century America.</P>  <P>1.

He held many jobs, working as an assembler, latheman, and mechanic before enrolling in a lettering class at the Connecticut League of Art Students in Hartford in 1905. Charles Noel Flagg, the school's director, persuaded Avery to transfer to a life-drawing class, which launched his career in fine arts. In 1918 Avery transferred to the School of Art at the Society of Hartford and exhibited his work while also holding down a variety of jobs, among them clerk and construction worker. In 1924 he became a member of the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts and a year later moved to New Jersey. From 1926 to 1938, he attended sketch classes at the Art Students League in New York, where he became a friend of Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman. In 1938 Avery worked as an artist in the Easel Division of the WPA Federal Art Project. About 1949, Avery began to experiment with monotypes. In 1952 he visited Europe and began working in woodcut.

After seeing several examples of Awa Tsireh's work for sale in a souvenir shop in 1917, Alice Corbin Henderson sought out the artist and through him developed a great respect for his work and that of his peers.  Awa Tsireh's success at selling his paintings, although few were sold for more than a dollar, encouraged other Pueblo artists to adapt their painting and design skills to the medium of watercolor paint on paper.  In the 1920s, Awa Tsireh received sponsorship from the School of American Research, then a branch of the Museum of New Mexico, to devote his full time to painting.

This brought him into daily contact at the School of American Research with Indian painters Fred Kabotie (Hopi) and Ma-Pe-Wi (Zia) and artist William P. Henderson, who occupied studios there. By the thirties, after his work had appeared in major exhibitions of Indian art in Chicago and New York, Awa Tsireh enjoyed a national reputation. With India ink and a brilliant, distinctive palette, he produced decorative paintings of great precision. His style developed from a naive realism, used to depict genre and dance scenes, through more abstract phases featuring landscape ""props"" and stylized animal forms.

First settled in 1640, Haverhill was one of the oldest towns in the Commonwealth. By the time of the Civil War, however, it was a center of the shoe-making industry in America and well on its way to becoming a mill city. From this urban environment Bacon marched off to fight with the Thirteenth Massachusetts Infantry. After his army service, Bacon traveled to Paris to study painting at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts. Unlike his peers, however, who returned to the states after an encounter with impressionism, Bacon remained abroad for the majority of his career, painting conservative historical genre scenes and pictures of the exotic Middle East. Dissimilar in subject matter, Bacon's paintings share a moralizing tone and a pervasive nostalgia for a primitive, pre-industrial past. Bacon's American subjects proved to be highly popular and his magnum opus, <i>The Boston Boys and General Gage, 1775,</i> was exhibited in Memorial Hall at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.</p><p>William H.

In 1920 Baizerman won a public competition to create a Civil Liberty monument for Grant's Tomb in New York but rejected the coveted commission to pursue the possibilities of hammered metal, a technique he discovered while working on small cast bronzes. Intrigued by the transitory effects of light and shadow on hammered metal surfaces, Baizerman executed ""City and the People,"" his first series using the technique in hammered bronze.

218,Artist Biography,"<p>Ball rose to prominence as the growing United States sought to commemorate its civic heroes in public spaces as well as in the home.

He made a career of portraying statesmen and historical figures, rendered in a naturalistic style somewhere between the inexpensive, moralizing sculpture groups cast in plaster by John Rogers and the high-style neoclassical marbles of Thomas Crawford and Hiram Powers. Ball was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The son of a house and sign painter, he served a brief apprenticeship with the Boston engraver Abel Brown before opening his own studio as a miniaturist and portrait painter. Soon after, Ball gave up his easel, distracted by a romantic disappointment and, according to legend, transferred his attention to a lump of clay. He found his calling and relocated to Italy.

George W. Whitaker, ""Reminiscences of Providence Artists,"" <i>Providence Magazine, The Board of Trade Journal</i> (Feb. 1914): 139.</p><br /><p>Edward Mitchell Bannister's determination to become a successful artist was largely fueled by an inflammatory article he read in the <i>New York Herald</i> in 1867, that stated ""the Negro seems to have an appreciation for art while being manifestly unable to produce it."" Ironically, less than a decade later, in 1876, Bannister was the first African-American artist to receive a national award.</p><p>Bannister was born in November 1828 in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada. His father was a native of Barbados, West Indies. The racial identity of Bannister's mother, Hannah Alexander Bannister, who lived in New Brunswick and whom Bannister credited with fostering his earliest artistic interests, is not known. Bannister's father apparently died early, and after the death of his mother in 1844 he lived with a white family in New Brunswick. Bannister left his foster home after several years and took a job at sea, as was customary for many young men from St. Andrews.</p><p>In 1848 Bannister moved to Boston where he held a variety of menial jobs before he became a barber and eventually learned to paint. Bannister painted in the Boston Studio Building, and also enrolled inseveral evening classes at Lowell Institute with the noted sculptor-anatomist Dr. William Rimmer.  Only a few of Bannister's paintings from the 1850s and 1860s have survived, preventing a stylistic assessment of his early period in Boston. While Bannister lived in Boston he must have seen and been influenced by the Barbizon School-inspired paintings of  William Morris Hunt who had studied in Europe and held numerous public exhibitions in Boston during the 1860s. American landscape painters were increasingly aware of the simple rustic motifs and pictorial poetry of French Barbizon paintings by Jean-Baptiste Corot, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet, and Charles-Fran&#231;ois Daubigny in the midnineteenth century.</p><p>On June 10, 1857, Bannister marriedChristiana Cartreaux, a Narragansett Indian who was born in North Kingston, Rhode Island. The couple had no children. Christiana worked as a wigmaker and hairdresser in Boston, and her Rhode Island background might have prompted the Bannisters to move from Boston to Providence, Rhode Island, in 1870.</p><p>Since Bannister's artistic studies were limited, it is remarkable, indeed, that within five years after his arrival in Providence, one of Bannister's paintings was accepted in thePhiladelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The painting, <i>Under the Oaks</i>, was selected for the first-prize bronze medal. Bannister related in considerable detail that the judges became indignant and originally wanted to ""reconsider"" the award upon discovering that Bannister was African American. The white competitors, however, upheld the decision and Bannister was awarded the bronze medal. The location of the painting has not been known since the turn of the century. </p><p>Following the Centennial Exposition, Bannister's reputation grew and numerous commissions enabled him to devote all his time to painting. He executed a large number of landscapes, most of which depict quiet, bucolic scenes rendered in somber tones and thick impasto. While Bannister'sinitial influence probably stemmed from the Barbizon-inspired works of William Morris Hunt, his paintings are reflective of an artist who loved the quiet beauties of nature and represented them in a realistic manner. Bannister's middle-period landscapes of the 1870s were generally executed in broad masses of heavy impasto with few details. They also evoke a tranquil mood that became one of the hallmarks of Bannister's style. Later landscapes of the 1880s and 1890s employed a more gentleimpasto and loosely applied broken color similar to impressionist techniques.</p><p>Many of Bannister's landscapes are small and have darkened considerably with age. His paintings contain no social or racial overtones, and the small figures seen frequently in his landscapes appear to be white. Although the majority of Bannister's paintings are landscapes, he also painted figure studies, religious scenes, seascapes, still lifes, and genre subjects. Bannister was attracted primarily to picturesque motifs including cottages, castles, cattle, dawns, sunsets, and small bodies of water, and he portrayed nature as a calm and submissive force in his works.</p><p>In spite of his limited training and experience, Bannister was among Providence's leading painters during the 1870s and 1880s. He was well liked and respected by his fellow citizens. On January 9, 1901, Bannister died while attending a prayer meeting at his church.  Shortly after his death, the Providence Art Club mounted a memorial exhibition of 101 of Bannister's paintings owned by Providence collectors. Bannister's grave in North Burial Ground, Providence, is marked by a rough granite boulder ten feet high bearing a carving of a palette with the artist's name and a pipe. A bronze plaque also adorns the monument and is inscribed with a poem, which reads in part, ""This pure and lofty soul . . . who, while he portrayed nature, walked with God.""  Edward M. Bannister was the only major African-American artist of the late nineteenth century who developed his talents without the benefit of European exposure.</p><p>Regenia A.

226,Luce Artist Biography,"<p>Edward Mitchell Bannister was one of the few African American painters of the nineteenth century to win significant recognition. He grew up on the coast in New Brunswick, and spent several months working as a ship's cook. He lost both his parents when he was young and moved to Boston, where he took sculpture classes and learned photography. Bannister faced an uphill battle to become a professional artist. In 1867 the <i>New York Herald</i> stated that ""the Negro seems to have an appreciation of art"" but went on to assert that blacks were ""manifestly unable to produce it"" (Driskell, <i>Two Centuries of Black American Art</i>, 1976). Bannister decided to prove the article wrong and in 1876 achieved his goal when one of his paintings won a medal at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. When he arrived to claim his prize, however, he was refused entry because he was black. Bannister was a founder and member of the Providence Art Club and was an original board member of the Rhode Island School of Design.</p>",NULL

Sloan and his friends painted scenes of New York's lively streets, and their journalistic eye and antiestablishment spirit captivated Barile. He joined the Society of Independent Artists, a group formed in 1916 to organize exhibitions of contemporary art free from the pressures of juries and prizes.

The following year he went to France, where he remainedfor more than ten years, studying at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts from 1884 to 1887. Barnard's work was stronglyinfluenced by that of the French master Auguste Rodin. Using the nude to signify themes such as love and the relationship between nature and humankind, Barnard worked primarily in stone. In 1894 his sculpture won acclaim at the salon of the Societ&eacute; Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Soon afterward he returned to the United States and settled in New York City.</p><p>From 1900 to 1904 he taught at the Art Students League while continuing to exhibit his work internationally and to execute numerous commissions. In 1902 he was commissioned to create sculptures for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg&mdash;the largest such commission awarded to an American up to that time. The project, consisting of more than sixty figures representing the history of humankind, occupied Barnard for eight years and made him famous. Among his other commissions was a series of statues of Abraham Lincoln for several cities.</p><p>Barnard was also renowned for his collection of medieval art, which became the basis of the Cloisters at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A second collection amassed by Barnard was soldby his estate to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

At age fifteen, Barnard became a taxidermist, which required him to build armatures and model forms. These skills, along with his love of classical art and his work as an engraver, led him to become an artist. He moved to Chicago to study at the Art Institute and on to Paris in 1883 to study at the ¨¦cole des Beaux-Arts.

241,Artist Biography,"<p>A well-known daguerrean artist in Oswego, New York, George N. Barnard had opened a photography studio in Syracuse by 1854.  He subsequently became affiliated with Mathew Brady's gallery in Washington, D.C., and photographed Lincoln's inauguration in 1861.  As an official Union Army photographer during the Civil War, he was given two mules, a covered wagon, and an African-American driver to follow several military campaigns, most notably General William Tecumseh' Sherman's famous march in 1864 from Chattanooga to Atlanta.  His reminisces of General Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, and Joseph Hooker made interesting reading for patrons of <i>Harper's Weekly, Leslie's,</i> and other contemporary periodicals and were illustrated by line engravings of his photographs.  Prompted by the success of Alexander Gardener's <i>Photographic Sketchbook of the War,</i> Barnard published <i>Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign</i> in 1866.  Including sixty-one photographs, a small volume of historical text, and several official campaign maps, the album weighed twenty pounds and sold for one hundred dollars.</p><p>Barnard made at least three photographs of the area around New Hope, Georgia, after the week-long battle in May 1864 between General Joseph Johnston's southern forces and Sherman's troops.  He often focused on broken trees and ravaged ground, as well as other melancholy views, such as the Jones Memorial on the grounds of Bonaventure Plantation near Savannah.  Barnard's album presents a complex symbolic picture of the appalling looses suffered in this national conflict.</p><p>Merry A.

245,Artist Biography,"<p>Between 1927 and 1930 Barnet studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and in the mid 1930s he taught in New York at the Art Students League and the New School for Social Research. Throughout his career Barnet has been a figurative artist, although in the late 1940s he experimented with eliminating realistic space and began using semiabstract forms to convey what he felt were substances and forces in nature. In the mid 1950s, he reduced his images to simple pictographs, although basic human shapes could still be discerned. Around 1960, however, he became dissatisfied with his attempts to unite human and abstract forms, and sought a fresh approach. Starting in 1962, when he exhibited a new series of paintings that reasserted the human figure as his primary subject matter, Barnet has continued to explore themes of meditation and human relationships.</p><p>Virginia M.

He worked as a printer for the school and experimented with techniques such as lithography, etching, and woodcutting. After his first son was born, Barnet began a series of paintings that show scenes of family life. He experimented with abstraction for several years, aiming to ""eliminate realistic space"" in favor of simple geometric forms. His later work was more representational and focused almost entirely on the female form, emphasizing the contrast between natural curves and rigidly composed backgrounds of horizontal and vertical forms.
